          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

            Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
            Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
            recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

            Now before you get angry with me, I know The Nightingale isn’t a
            Horror film, but that doesn’t make it any less horrifying. I can’t
            remember another film in recent years that I peeked at through my
            fingers as much as I did this one. Particularly the scene I’ve
            featured. It’s destroying. BRUTAL with a capital B.R.U.T.A.L. As
            with every film I share here, I highly recommend you watch the full
            film before you watch just this scene. It concerns a major plot
            point that you really deserve to learn the way the filmmaker
            intended, and not out of context on some jerk’s fanboy site. The
            Nightingale was written and directed by Jennifer Kent of The
            Babadook (2014) fame and shows her having grown exponentially since
            that film’s release (and she was already pretty remarkable). The
            film is not for the faint of heart, trust. There were several
            moments where I just had to take a short pause. Lead actor Aisling
            Franciosi, who plays Clare, a young Irish convict who seeks revenge
            for a terrible act of violence committed against her family, is
            absolutely outstanding. If it weren’t for her, many scenes may have
            actually verged on being a bit exploitative. But she throws herself
            in completely and and just tears your heart to shreds. When all is
            said and done, it almost feels like you actually witnessed something
            personally. So while it isn’t “Horror” per se, it is without a doubt
            some of the most horrifying passages I’ve ever seen on film. If you
            don’t feel the same after watching it, I’m truly concerned about
            you.
