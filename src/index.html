      BEST HORROR SCENES An ever growing collection featuring some of the best
      scenes in horror. “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel
      are some of the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat
      scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that
      aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

      Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by Brandon Durham. Most
      film clips contain major spoilers, and it is recommended you don’t watch
      the clip if you plan on seeing the film.
